## Release path & compromise scope

Facts a maintainer would need at 2am if the release identity is compromised. Generic incident-response steps (rotating credentials, revoking OAuth apps, publishing advisories, unlisting NuGet packages) are not duplicated here — GitHub's and NuGet's own docs update faster than a checked-in runbook.

- **Release path**: OIDC / NuGet Trusted Publishing via `NuGet/login@v1` in `.github/workflows/release.yaml`. The workflow mints an ephemeral push token per run via OIDC — the release path does not depend on a long-lived API key stored in GitHub secrets or on the NuGet account. During an incident, check the NuGet account for any long-lived API keys anyway (they can be created outside of CI) and delete anything you don't recognize.
- **Fallback**: none. If Trusted Publishing is compromised, the incident is at the GitHub-account level (the OIDC identity is `Chris-Wolfgang/ETL-Xml`).
- **Owner**: @Chris-Wolfgang.
- **Downstream consumers**: none known within the Wolfgang.* family — `Wolfgang.Etl.Xml` is a leaf library that nothing else in the family depends on. Unknown external consumers may exist on nuget.org.
- **Package coordinates for unlisting**: `Wolfgang.Etl.Xml` on nuget.org — https://www.nuget.org/packages/Wolfgang.Etl.Xml/. This repo ships a single package.
