// SourceLink PDB gates — the mechanical preconditions for F11-into-source.
//
// Interactive-debugger step-into is not automatable in an ordinary CI job, but
// the things that make it work ARE: the assembly's PDB must be portable (not
// full-format), it must carry a SourceLink CustomDebugInformation record, that
// record must map this repo's source paths to GitHub raw URLs, and those URLs
// must actually resolve. If all of those hold, F11-into-source works by
// construction; if any breaks, a consumer's debugger silently falls back to
// decompiled placeholders.
